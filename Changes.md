## Overview

This document summarizes the refactoring and improvements made to the legacy User Management API to enhance code quality, security, maintainability, and best practices while preserving all existing functionality.

## üîç Major Issues Identified

1. **SQL Injection Vulnerabilities**

   * Raw SQL queries were constructed using string interpolation (e.g., `f"SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = '{user_id}'"`).
   * This made the application highly vulnerable to SQL injection attacks.

2. **Poor Code Structure and Repetition**

   * Database connection and cursor handling were repeated in every endpoint.
   * Inline and redundant SQL code appeared throughout.

3. **Lack of Error Handling**

   * No use of `try-except` blocks to catch and handle errors.
   * The app printed messages to the console without structured API responses.

4. **Incorrect HTTP Responses**

   * API endpoints returned plain strings instead of JSON.
   * HTTP status codes were not consistently used or accurate.

5. **Input Validation Missing**

   * No checks for required fields or invalid input (e.g., empty name, email, password).

## ‚úÖ Changes Made

### 1. **Security Fixes**

* Replaced all raw SQL with **parameterized queries** using `?` placeholders to prevent SQL injection.

### 2. **Database Abstraction**

* Created a reusable function `get_db_connection()` to manage SQLite connections and reduce duplication.
* Enabled `row_factory = sqlite3.Row` for cleaner dictionary-like access to query results.

### 3. **Code Cleanup and Organization**

* Removed repetitive code and unnecessary print statements.
* Simplified data fetching and transformation logic using list comprehensions and `jsonify()`.

### 4. **Error Handling and Status Codes**

* Wrapped each route in `try-except` blocks.
* Returned meaningful error messages with appropriate HTTP status codes (e.g., `400`, `401`, `404`, `500`).

### 5. **Input Validation**

* Added checks to ensure `name`, `email`, and `password` are present before inserting or updating users.
